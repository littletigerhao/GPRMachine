GPRMachine Makes Multi-Step-Ahead Prediction from A Short-term Time Series

# Datasets
## Coupled Time-Variant Lorentz System
This is a synthetic 90-dimension time-variant coupled Lorentz system.

## Wind Dataset
This 155-dimension dataset is collected in Japan by the Japan Methodological Agency. Each variable represents the wind speed at different wind station.

## Traffic Dataset
This 207-dimension dataset contains traffic speed collected from 207 loop detectors in the highway of Los Angeles County. Each variable represents the traffic flow at different detectors.

## Typhoon Eye Trace dataset
This 241-dimensional dataset comes from the satellite cloud image data recording the route of typhoon Marcus collected by National Institute of Informatics. Each variable represents the cloud image.

# Requirements
